# Batch Login System
This is a simple but complex system that you could add to your batch files. If you have any ideas but don't know how to add them please open an Issue. If you have an idea and do know how to add it, please open a Pull Request, Please not also that this only works on Windows Computers!

# WARNING
This does create folders and files on your computer. It doesn't download any files from an external source. It just creates files like you would but in a faster way. You can change where the files are created by editing the code. **Warning**(Again) If you do change the directory, you have to do that with every other line of code that has the directory.
